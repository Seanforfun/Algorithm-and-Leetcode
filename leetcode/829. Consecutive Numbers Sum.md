## 829. Consecutive Numbers Sum

### Question
Given a positive integer N, how many ways can we write it as a sum of consecutive positive integers?

```
Example 1:

Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 = 5 = 2 + 3
Example 2:

Input: 9
Output: 3
Explanation: 9 = 9 = 4 + 5 = 2 + 3 + 4
Example 3:

Input: 15
Output: 4
Explanation: 15 = 15 = 8 + 7 = 4 + 5 + 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
Note: 1 <= N <= 10 ^ 9.
```

### Solution:
* Method 1: Math
  * We assume the first term is x and totally m terms.
  * 2xm + m(m - 1) = 2N => we try all possible m and find if there is a valid x.
  ```Java
  class Solution {
      public int consecutiveNumbersSum(int N) {
          int res = 0;
          for(int m = 1;;m++){
              int mx = 2 * N - m *(m - 1);
              if(mx <= 0) break;
              else if(mx % (2 * m) == 0) res++;
          }
          return res;
      }
  }
  ```
