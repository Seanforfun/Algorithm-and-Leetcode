## 710. Random Pick with Blacklist

### Question
Given a blacklist B containing unique integers from [0, N), write a function to return a uniform random integer from [0, N) which is NOT in B.

Optimize it such that it minimizes the call to system’s Math.random().

Note:
1. 1 <= N <= 1000000000
2. 0 <= B.length < min(100000, N)
3. [0, N) does NOT include N. See interval notation.

```
Example 1:

Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[1,[]],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,0,0]

Example 2:

Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[2,[]],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,1,1,1]

Example 3:

Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[3,[1]],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,0,2]

Example 4:

Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[4,[2]],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,1,3,1]
```

Explanation of Input Syntax:

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has two arguments, N and the blacklist B. pick has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.


### Thinking:
* Method 1: TLE / MLE
    ```Java
    class Solution {
        private Set<Integer> black;
        private int[] valid;
        private Random random;
        private int N;
        private int size;
        public Solution(int N, int[] blacklist) {
            this.black = new HashSet<>();
            for(int b : blacklist) this.black.add(b);
            this.valid = new int[N - blacklist.length];
            int count = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
                if(this.black.contains(i)) continue;
                this.valid[count++] = i;
            }
            this.size = this.valid.length;
            this.random = new Random();
            this.N = N;
        }
        
        public int pick() {
            return this.valid[Math.abs(random.nextInt()) % size];
        }
    }
    
    /**
     * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
     * Solution obj = new Solution(N, blacklist);
     * int param_1 = obj.pick();
     */
    ```

* Method 2: reorder HashMap
    1. We first create a hashtable for saving all blacklist.
    2. we insert all the valid numbers to previous blacklist positions.
    3. Use random to get a random value, if that value is in the map, we return the value, otherwise, we just return the value directly.
    ```Java
    class Solution {
        private Map<Integer, Integer> map;
        private Random random;
        private int M;
        public Solution(int N, int[] blacklist) {
            this.random = new Random();
            this.map = new HashMap<>();
            for(int b : blacklist){
                map.put(b, -1);
            }
            this.M = N - blacklist.length;
            N--;
            for(int b : blacklist){
                if(b < M){
                    while(map.containsKey(N)) N--; 
                    map.put(b, N--);
                }
            }
        }
        
        public int pick() {
            int next = random.nextInt(M);
            return map.containsKey(next) ? map.get(next): next;
        }
    }
    
    /**
     * Your Solution object will be instantiated and called as such:
     * Solution obj = new Solution(N, blacklist);
     * int param_1 = obj.pick();
     */
    ```
