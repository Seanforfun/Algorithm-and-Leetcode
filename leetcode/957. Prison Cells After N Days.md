## 957. Prison Cells After N Days

### Question
There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or vacant.

Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:

    If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
    Otherwise, it becomes vacant.

(Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.)

We describe the current state of the prison in the following way: cells[i] == 1 if the i-th cell is occupied, else cells[i] == 0.

Given the initial state of the prison, return the state of the prison after N days (and N such changes described above.)

```
Example 1:

Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], N = 7
Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
Explanation: 
The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:
Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Example 2:

Input: cells = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0], N = 1000000000
Output: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]
```

Note:
* cells.length == 8
* cells[i] is in {0, 1}
* 1 <= N <= 10^9



### Thinking:
* Method 1: 
    ```Java
    class Solution {
        public int[] prisonAfterNDays(int[] cells, int N) {
            N = N % 14 == 0 ? 14: N % 14;
            for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
                int[] next = new int[8];
                for(int j = 1; j < 7; j++){
                    next[j] = cells[j - 1] == cells[j + 1] ? 1: 0;
                }
                cells = next;
            }
            return cells;
        }
    }
    ```

### Amazon session
* Method 1: Math
	1. We found that the result repeats after every 14 iterations.
	```Java
	class Solution {
		public int[] prisonAfterNDays(int[] cells, int N) {
			N = N % 14 == 0 ? 14: N % 14;
			for(int i = 0; i < N; i++){
				int[] next = new int[8];
				for(int j = 1; j < 7; j++){
					next[j] = cells[j - 1] == cells[j + 1] ? 1: 0;
				}
				cells = next;
			}
			return cells;
		}
	}
