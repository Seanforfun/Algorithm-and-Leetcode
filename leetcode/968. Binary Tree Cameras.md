## 968. Binary Tree Cameras

### Question:
Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree. 
Each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.
Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

```
Example 1:

Input: [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.

Example 2:

Input: [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.
```

Note:
1. The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range [1, 1000].
2. Every node has value 0.

### Solution:
* Method 1: dfs + Greedy
    * I didn't get this question by myself.
    ```Java
    /**
     * Definition for a binary tree node.
     * public class TreeNode {
     *     int val;
     *     TreeNode left;
     *     TreeNode right;
     *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
     * }
     */
    class Solution {
        private static final int NULL = 0;
        private static final int COVER = 1;
        private static final int CAMERA = 2;
        private int res;
        public int minCameraCover(TreeNode root) {
            if(dfs(root) == NULL) res++;
            return res;
        }
        private int dfs(TreeNode node){
            if(node == null) return COVER;
            int left = dfs(node.left);
            int right = dfs(node.right);
            if(left == NULL || right == NULL){
                res++;
                return CAMERA;
            }
            if(left == CAMERA || right == CAMERA) return COVER;
            return NULL;
        }
    }
    ```
