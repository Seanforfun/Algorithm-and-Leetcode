## 435. Non-overlapping Intervals

### Question
Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Note:

You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.

```
Example 1:

Input: [ [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,3] ]

Output: 1

Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.


Example 2:

Input: [ [1,2], [1,2], [1,2] ]

Output: 2

Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.


Example 3:

Input: [ [1,2], [2,3] ]

Output: 0

Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

### Solution
* Method 1: Sort + Greedy
  ```Java
  class Solution {
      public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
          int len = intervals.length;
          if(len == 0) return 0;
          Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b)->{
              return a[1] - b[1];
          });
          int end = intervals[0][1];
          int count = 1;
          for(int i = 1; i < len; i++){
              if(intervals[i][0] >= end){
                  end = intervals[i][1];
                  count++;
              }
          }
          return len - count;
      }
  }
  ```
