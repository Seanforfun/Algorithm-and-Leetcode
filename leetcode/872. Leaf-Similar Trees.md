## 872. Leaf-Similar Trees

### Question:
Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.

```
For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.
```

Note:
* Both of the given trees will have between 1 and 100 nodes.

### Solution:
* Method 1: dfs
    ```Java
    /**
     * Definition for a binary tree node.
     * public class TreeNode {
     *     int val;
     *     TreeNode left;
     *     TreeNode right;
     *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
     * }
     */
    class Solution {
        private List<Integer> leaves1;
        private List<Integer> leaves2;
        public boolean leafSimilar(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
            this.leaves1 = new ArrayList<>();
            this.leaves2 = new ArrayList<>();
            dfs(root1, leaves1);
            dfs(root2, leaves2);
            if(leaves1.size() != leaves2.size()) return false;
            for(int i = 0; i < leaves1.size(); i++){
                if(leaves1.get(i) != leaves2.get(i)) return false;
            }
            return true;
        }
        private void dfs(TreeNode node, List<Integer> list){
            if(node.left == null && node.right == null){
                list.add(node.val);
                return;
            }
            if(node.left != null) dfs(node.left, list);
            if(node.right != null) dfs(node.right, list);
        }
    }
    ```
