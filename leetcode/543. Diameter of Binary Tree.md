## 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

### Question:
 Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
 
```
Example:
Given a binary tree

          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    

Return 3, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```

Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them. 

### Solution:
* Method 1: Divide and conquer(Recursion).
    ```Java
    /**
     * Definition for a binary tree node.
     * public class TreeNode {
     *     int val;
     *     TreeNode left;
     *     TreeNode right;
     *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
     * }
     */
    class Solution {
        private int result;
        public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
            if(root == null) return 0;
            maxPath(root);
            return this.result - 1;
        }
        private int maxPath(TreeNode root){
            if(root == null) return 0;
            int left = maxPath(root.left);
            int right = maxPath(root.right);
            this.result = Math.max(result, left + right + 1);
            return Math.max(left, right) + 1;
        }
    }
    ```
