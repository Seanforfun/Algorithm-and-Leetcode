## 959. Regions Cut By Slashes

### Question
In a N x N grid composed of 1 x 1 squares, each 1 x 1 square consists of a /, \, or blank space.  These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.

(Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a \ is represented as "\\".)

Return the number of regions.

```
Example 1:

Input:
[
  " /",
  "/ "
]
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:

Example 2:

Input:
[
  " /",
  "  "
]
Output: 1
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:

Example 3:

Input:
[
  "\\/",
  "/\\"
]
Output: 4
Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "\\/" refers to \/, and "/\\" refers to /\.)
The 2x2 grid is as follows:

Example 4:

Input:
[
  "/\\",
  "\\/"
]
Output: 5
Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "/\\" refers to /\, and "\\/" refers to \/.)
The 2x2 grid is as follows:

Example 5:

Input:
[
  "//",
  "/ "
]
Output: 3
Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:
```

* Method 1: union-find
  * this trick of this question is how can we connect all cells. so we divide all cells into 4 parts and slash will only effect the connection bwtween all triangles.
  * According to the question, there are 3 conditions:
    * empty, means all triangles are all connected.
    * normal slash, union(0, 1), union(2, 3).
    * reverse slash, union(0, 3), union(1, 2).
