## 348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe

### Question
Design a Tic-tac-toe game that is played between two players on a n x n grid.

You may assume the following rules:

A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves is allowed.
A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
```
Example:
Given n = 3, assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.

TicTacToe toe = new TicTacToe(3);

toe.move(0, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| | |
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
| | | |

toe.move(0, 2, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
| | | |

toe.move(2, 2, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
| | |X|

toe.move(1, 1, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
| | |X|

toe.move(2, 0, 1); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
| |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(1, 0, 2); -> Returns 0 (no one wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
|X| |X|

toe.move(2, 1, 1); -> Returns 1 (player 1 wins)
|X| |O|
|O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
|X|X|X|
```

Could you do better than O(n2) per move() operation?

### Solution
* Method 1：　Design
  ```Java
  class TicTacToe {
      private int[][] pad;
      private int n;
      /** Initialize your data structure here. */
      public TicTacToe(int n) {
          this.pad = new int[n][n];
          this.n = n;
      }

      /** Player {player} makes a move at ({row}, {col}).
          @param row The row of the board.
          @param col The column of the board.
          @param player The player, can be either 1 or 2.
          @return The current winning condition, can be either:
                  0: No one wins.
                  1: Player 1 wins.
                  2: Player 2 wins. */

          tx = row;

              }
          }
          return res0 || res1;
      }
  }
