## 503. Next Greater Element II

### Question
Given a circular array (the next element of the last element is the first element of the array), print the Next Greater Number for every element. The Next Greater Number of a number x is the first greater number to its traversing-order next in the array, which means you could search circularly to find its next greater number. If it doesn't exist, output -1 for this number.

```
Example 1:
Input: [1,2,1]
Output: [2,-1,2]
Explanation: The first 1's next greater number is 2;
The number 2 can't find next greater number;
The second 1's next greater number needs to search circularly, which is also 2.
```

Note: The length of given array won't exceed 10000.

### Solution
* Method 1: Array O(n^2)
  ```Java
  class Solution {
      public int[] nextGreaterElements(int[] nums) {
          int[] result = new int[nums.length];
          for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
              int j = i + 1;
              while(j != i){
                  if(j == nums.length){
                      j = 0;
                      if(j == i) break;
                  }
                  if(nums[j] > nums[i]){
                      result[i] = nums[j];
                      break;
                  }
                  j++;
              }
              if(j == i) result[i] = -1;
          }
          return result;
      }
  }
  ```
