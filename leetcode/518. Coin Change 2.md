## 518. Coin Change 2

### Question
You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the number of combinations that make up that amount. You may assume that you have infinite number of each kind of coin.

```
Example 1:

Input: amount = 5, coins = [1, 2, 5]
Output: 4
Explanation: there are four ways to make up the amount:
5=5
5=2+2+1
5=2+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+1+1

Example 2:

Input: amount = 3, coins = [2]
Output: 0
Explanation: the amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.

Example 3:

Input: amount = 10, coins = [10] 
Output: 1
```
 

Note:

You can assume that
1. 0 <= amount <= 5000
2. 1 <= coin <= 5000
3. the number of coins is less than 500
4. the answer is guaranteed to fit into signed 32-bit integer

### Solutions
* Method 1: Recursion TLE
	```Java
	class Solution {
		private int amount;
		private int[] coins;
		private int res;
		public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
			this.amount = amount;
			this.coins = coins;
			dfs(0, 0);
			return res;
		}
		private void dfs(int index, int sum){
			if(sum == amount) res++;
			else if(sum < amount){
				for(int i = index; i < coins.length; i++){
					dfs(i, sum + coins[i]);
				}
			}
		}
	}
	```

* Method 2: dp
	```Java
	class Solution {
		public int change(int amount, int[] coins) {
			int[] dp = new int[amount + 1];
			dp[0] = 1;
			for(int coin :coins){
				for(int i = 1; i <= amount; i++){
					if(i - coin >= 0)
						dp[i] += dp[i - coin];
				}
			}
			return dp[amount];
		}
	}
	```
