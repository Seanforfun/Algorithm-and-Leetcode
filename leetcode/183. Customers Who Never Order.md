## 183. Customers Who Never Order

### Question
Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: Customers.

+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+

Table: Orders.

+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+

Using the above tables as example, return the following:

+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+

### Thinking:
* Method

```SQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select
    Name as Customers
from
    Customers
where
    Id
not in(
    select CustomerId from Orders
);
```

### 二刷
1. 还是想到使用not in连接多次查询。
```MySQL
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT c.Name as Customers
FROM Customers c
WHERE c.id not in (
SELECT o.CustomerId FROM Orders o
);
```
