## 785. Is Graph Bipartite?

### Question:
Given an undirected graph, return true if and only if it is bipartite.

Recall that a graph is bipartite if we can split it's set of nodes into two independent subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B.

The graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a list of indexes j for which the edge between nodes i and j exists.  Each node is an integer between 0 and graph.length - 1.  There are no self edges or parallel edges: graph[i] does not contain i, and it doesn't contain any element twice.

```
Example 1:
Input: [[1,3], [0,2], [1,3], [0,2]]
Output: true
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
0----1
|    |
|    |
3----2
We can divide the vertices into two groups: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.

Example 2:
Input: [[1,2,3], [0,2], [0,1,3], [0,2]]
Output: false
Explanation: 
The graph looks like this:
0----1
| \  |
|  \ |
3----2
We cannot find a way to divide the set of nodes into two independent subsets.
```

Note:
* graph will have length in range [1, 100].
* graph[i] will contain integers in range [0, graph.length - 1].
* graph[i] will not contain i or duplicate values.
* The graph is undirected: if any element j is in graph[i], then i will be in graph[j].

### Solution:
* Method 1: dfs + bopartite
    ```Java
    class Solution {
        private int[][] g;
        private int[] visited;
        public boolean isBipartite(int[][] graph) {
            g = graph;
            visited = new int[graph.length];        
            for(int i = 0; i < graph.length; i++){
                if(visited[i] == 0){
                    if(!dfs(i, 1))  return false;
                }
            }
            return true;
        }
        private boolean dfs(int node, int color){
            if(visited[node] == -color) return false;
            else if(visited[node] == color) return true;
            visited[node] = color;
            int[] neighbours = g[node];
            for(Integer neighbour : neighbours){
                if(!dfs(neighbour, -color)) return false;
            }
            return true;
        }
    }
    ```

* Method 2: bfs
    ```Java
    class Solution {
        public boolean isBipartite(int[][] graph) {
            int[] visited = new int[graph.length];
            Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
            for(int i = 0; i < graph.length; i++){
                if(visited[i] == 0){
                    visited[i] = 1;
                    queue.offer(i);
                    while(!queue.isEmpty()){
                        int cur = queue.poll();
                        for(Integer next : graph[cur]){
                            if(visited[next] == visited[cur]) return false;
                            else if(visited[next] == 0){
                                visited[next] = -visited[cur];
                                queue.offer(next);
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            return true;
        }
    }
    ```
